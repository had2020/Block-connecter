# Block-connecter
A Godot 4 project in which you can connect blocks, saving is still work in progress

# About the project 
I made it for a future project, its a godot 4 game,
in which you drag blocks and connect them.
I will use this project for a ship editor, in a space sim

# How to run the project
This project was created in Godot 4.2, Any Godot 4 verison should work, but I can't say if it will work on
